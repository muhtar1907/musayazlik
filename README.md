My name is Musa Yazlık. I was born in 1997 Kayseri city of Turkey. I took my first step into software life by winning
the Computer Programming department of Erciyes University Kayseri Vocational School. I am currently continuing my
education life by studying double universities, namely Eskişehir Osmangazi University Mathematics-Computer Sciences and
Anadolu University Management Information Systems. I have been dealing with web software since 2017 June. At first I
started web software with the Php programming language. Later on, I also turned to the front end and the design side. I
am currently i focused entirely on the front end to specialize. At the same time, I continue to design on figma as a
hobby.
